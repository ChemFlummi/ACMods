                  <p class="u-text u-text-2">I started AC modding because I wanted cars that were not available for Assetto Corsa at that time..
                    The first car was an older version of the Camaro GT3. Modding a car is a good and interesting way to learn and improve my modelling skills and physical understanding about my favorite hobby: Cars&nbsp;<br>Modding with &lt;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Discord: ​ChemFlum​mi#5977<br>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-2">The Dodge Viper evolved into its 3rd generation model at the 2012 New York Motor Show.&nbsp;<br> With the appearance of this iconic American sports car, the development of a GTS-R competition model was also announced, and it became clear that the Viper would return once again to the Le Mans 24 hour race and American Le Mans series after a 10-year hiatus.&nbsp;<br> And the Viper GT3-R is a GT3 machine created for private teams, based on the GTS-R works machine.&nbsp;<br>

                    In the development of this machine, SRT (the high-performance car development division of Dodge) and Riley Technologies (a major race constructor of the U.S.) worked together to instil the car with their know-how for victory.&nbsp;<br>
                    
                    The traditional long nosed, short deck body has improved aerodynamics with a flat bottom and the addition of a wing.&nbsp;<br> Weight has also been reduced to 1,295 kg (2855 lbs).&nbsp;<br> The 8.4 litre V10 with a dry sump is powered up to 670 BHP (507kW) unrestricted, and this power is transferred with an X-Trac 6-speed sequential transmission. &nbsp;<br>It is also equipped with 6 piston front/4 piston rear brake callipers with large diameter discs for stopping power.&nbsp;<br>
                    
                    The Viper GT3-R was priced at $459,000, with orders received from the latter half of 2013. Its level of performance is already proven in various GT Car races in the US and other parts of the world.</p>

Model and physics again from ACC and he has the usual features.&nbsp;<br>Sadly we have to do without the Frikadelli skin in the Mod.&nbsp;<br>But my Friend Mediiza has made a Frikadelli Skin on Racedepartment.&nbsp;<br>But both Racingone Skins from @Creativehighway  are included and 4 Skins from @Fundee Motorsport Photography™  in addition to the Carbon Skin.&nbsp;<br>I hope you have fun with the car and can drive as confidently as the Frikadelli team did the last 24h!&nbsp;<br>Sound is from Ty_playz from Racedepartment and I was allowed to use it.&nbsp;<br>BOP of the car to the others is in work, I personally would start at 50kg.&nbsp;<br>Anyway have fun!&nbsp;<br>Version 1.1:
Changed Motion Ratio because of too soft dampers
Spring rates adjusted
Base Setup improved
Ride height realigned&nbsp;<br>Version 1.3:
Complete suspension rework (car had big problems over Curbs)
Lowered base tire pressure<br>&nbsp;Fixed Autoshifter

                    Our community safety car!
                    After the vote, it became the Alfa Romeo 4C, which is a bit boring on its own.
                    That's why I built a small scratch-made Aero Kit to better adapt the car to the LMPs!
                    Additionally, there were slightly larger turbochargers installed so that the Alfa can come out of the corner quickly enough.
                    I had a lot of fun with this slightly different project, hope you like the little racing machine too!
                    The orange flashing safety car light is activated with EXTRA_A (a CSP button in the settings, default Alt+Num7).
                    And the two green clearance lights are activated with EXTRA_B (default Alt+Num8).&nbsp;</p>

Original: 650HP, 1100+NM
Mod: 650HP, 1177NM&nbsp;<br>Its weight is 925 kg and you can fill 81 Liters in it.&nbsp;<br>The highlight of the Mod are the animated Winglets on the Front and the Light Refraction in the front lights&nbsp;<br>The base Setup is very balanced and if you are not happy with it, you can change all things that are changable in AC xD&nbsp;<br>Have Fun with the Car<br>&nbsp;Yours Max

                  <p class="u-text u-text-2">The Koenigsegg CCX
                    Built from 2006 to 2010
                    During this time, 49 vehicles were produced.
                    The CCX is the last vehicle of the CC series, and the "X" represents the Roman numeral 10, referring to the first prototype created by Christian von Koenigsegg in 1886.
                    Powered by an 806 horsepower 4.7-liter V8 engine with 2 compressors, this car is said to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.2 seconds and achieve a top speed of slightly over 390 km/h.
                    My version is inspired by a dynamometer run of the car.&nbsp;</p>
