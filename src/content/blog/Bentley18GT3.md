Today a new Release from me: 
The Bentley Continental GT3 2018
 The car has the following features: 
Sprint and Endu Kit LED Lights via Config 
Working SAS Display + Racelogic with switchable Pages via EXTRA_A 
DRL on of under idle RPM or via EXTRA_B 
Rain Tires + physics 
Sound by Corsamode 
The car is pretty easy to drive, it is just a little bit edgy out of the corners. 
Included in the car folder is a PDF File with all the needed informations for skinning
