There it is, the long-awaited C7 GT3-R! 

For me one of the best and most beautiful GT3 cars of all time! 
I'm really glad that I had the opportunity to work on this car! T
his was made possible by @Von Boyage, who gave me the base model from RF2. 
I did a lot of remapping and remeshing to make the car look good and I hope I succeeded! 
The standard version is unrestricted, but recommended restrictor settings of the Fia are given in the information, then racing with the URD M4 should be possible. 
Have fun with the car and give me feedback! 
Big thanks to @CaddyDPi too for some of the skins!
