The Koenigsegg CCX Built from 2006 to 2010 During this time, 49 vehicles were produced. The CCX is the last vehicle of the CC series, and the "X" represents the Roman numeral 10, referring to the first prototype created by Christian von Koenigsegg in 1886. Powered by an 806 horsepower 4.7-liter V8 engine with 2 compressors, this car is said to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.2 seconds and achieve a top speed of slightly over 390 km/h. My version is inspired by a dynamometer run of the car.
