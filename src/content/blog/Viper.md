The RWD brand is a fictional car brand, created by the Canadian Ryan Day. He designed the RWD-Fenix P20-4 for the Project Cars game. It is a fictional LMP2 with a Single Turbo Flat 4 engine and a pneumatic hybrid system. The car has 471bhp and 532Nm of torque combined with a dry weight of 940kg. That makes the P20-4 to a weapon on almost every track!
