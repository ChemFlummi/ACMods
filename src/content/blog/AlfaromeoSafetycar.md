Our community safety car! After the vote, it became the Alfa Romeo 4C, which is a bit boring on its own. That's why I built a small scratch-made Aero Kit to better adapt the car to the LMPs! Additionally, there were slightly larger turbochargers installed so that the Alfa can come out of the corner quickly enough. I had a lot of fun with this slightly different project, hope you like the little racing machine too! The orange flashing safety car light is activated with EXTRA_A (a CSP button in the settings, default Alt+Num7). And the two green clearance lights are activated with EXTRA_B (default Alt+Num8).
