Today it's the turn of the two Reiter Engineering cars: the SaReNi Camaro GT and the Reiter Gallardo R-EX GT3. Once again, the cars were made with a lot of passion and they have many different features: Gallardo:
fully functional display and Racelogic with 2 pages each (use EXTRA_A and EXTRA_B to change).
Sprint and Endu configuration depending on the skin
realistic physics based on real data
fully working lights outside + inside
Wobbling Exhaust
damage and dirt textures
Rain tires + physics
windshield wipers + automatic rain light
fully animated rear wing with correct bolt position for all 15 slots
Sound by @SoundModFella
Camaro: fully functional display with 2 pages (use EXTRA_B to change)
daytime running lights can be deactivated by EXTRA_A
all years with their bodykits
realistic physics based on real data
fully working lights outside + inside
rain tires + physics
windshield wipers
Together both cars are probably the white beauty and the black beast Thanks to all who helped and I hope you are looking forward to the underdogs of the GT3 sport.
