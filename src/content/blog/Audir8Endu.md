Here it is, the Audi R8 LMS Ultra Endu Spec It is just a skin config for the kunos one It comes in 3 Versions: 
Endurance with Swan neck wing 

Endurance with old style wing (Bilstein Audi R8 for example) 

Sprint Spec with the old style wing 

Addon Models from GT6 or scratch made 

To use it in your skin, just look for the correct skin folder and take the config

 ATTENTION: The old style wing has a new baked AO map because of the missing shadows of the swan neck, so please use the psd file for that! 

And now have fun with this car
