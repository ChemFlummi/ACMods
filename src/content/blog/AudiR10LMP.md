The Audi R10, a race car from 2006 and the first Diesel LMP.
Sadly there are no good mods of this time.. 
I found this R10 somewhere and updated it to todays standards 
The model is from Forza Motorsport 4, but a very bad conversion 
So I started to study the specs of the car and wanted to be as near as possible to the real car: Original: 650HP, 1100+NM Mod: 650HP, 1177NM 
Its weight is 925 kg and you can fill 81 Liters in it. 
The highlight of the Mod are the animated Winglets on the Front and the Light Refraction in the front lights 
The base Setup is very balanced and if you are not happy with it, you can change all things that are changable in AC xD 
Have Fun with the Car
 Yours Max
