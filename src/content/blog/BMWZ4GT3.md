Congratulations to the Frikadelli Racing Team for winning today's race! 
To celebrate this victory, I release today my 296 GT3 on this server Model and physics again from ACC and he has the usual features. 
Sadly we have to do without the Frikadelli skin in the Mod. 
But my Friend Mediiza has made a Frikadelli Skin on Racedepartment. 
But both Racingone Skins from @Creativehighway are included and 4 Skins from @Fundee Motorsport Photographyâ„¢ in addition to the Carbon Skin. 
I hope you have fun with the car and can drive as confidently as the Frikadelli team did the last 24h! 
Sound is from Ty_playz from Racedepartment and I was allowed to use it. 
BOP of the car to the others is in work, I personally would start at 50kg. 
Anyway have fun!
